Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project


In this case we need to create a data set that need to follow this steps:

  1. Download the dataset from web if it does not already exist in the working directory.
  2. Read both the train and test datasets and merge them into measurements(X), activity(Y) and subject.
  3. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  4. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  5. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  6. From the data set in step 5, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the 
     average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
